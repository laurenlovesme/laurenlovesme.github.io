          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I am an 11th grader in String Theory High School. In my opinion football is the greatest sport ever. Im a baseball and basketball fan but football is my favorite. My favortie team is the Pittsburgh Steeler. QB Ben Roethlisberger is my favortie football player ever. Im a kid from South Philadelphia. I like all Philly sports teams except the eagles arent my favorite. Ive been a Steelers fan all my life. Reason is after the eagles lost to Carolina back in 2003 i hated them so much i have no idea why but after that i looked up "all nfl teams" and picked the Steelers because i liked thier logo after that i loved them. They have been in 3 SuperBowls and won 2 of them since I was a fan. Now as I got older I understood more about the sport and the rules i also new about the players. My fanily started a Fantasy league and I wanted my own team after research I learned what to do and how it works. The biggest thing I learned was that its all luck. there is no skill in fantasy football at all. Just because the player you pick for your team is a big name or gets paid alot of money does not mean they will do good everyweek. It takes one wrong move for the player to get injured and then he is useless for you.  </p>
